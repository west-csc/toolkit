# :school_satchel: Our Toolkit

This respository should contain write-ups of (most of the) different CTF competitions that members of the West Computer Security Club has participated in, as well as any various files from coding competitions.
It would be ideal to create a set of crypto tools, as well as a code snippet collection here as well.

### :pencil: Want to help?
